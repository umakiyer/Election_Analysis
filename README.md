## Election Summary
     - The script can be used as is for any number of candidates and counties.
     - The script can be modified to determine the number of votes each candidate got from different counties( using conditional loops).
     - If the dataset had a column for the office for which the vote was cast, then we have to modify the script
       to extend analyse to different offices.( using conditional loops)
